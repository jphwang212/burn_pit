# Pyrograph

Vets Hackathon December 18-20 in the year of our dark lord, 2020


### The Problem

> [**“I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist. But, I'm also not an idiot. If you live next to a toxic smoke plume filled with cancer-causing elements, and you're breathing it in day in and day out, it's going to make you sick," Stewart said, regarding what many veterans have faced since returning from war.”**](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/16/913376758/jon-stewart-uses-his-celebrity-to-bring-attention-to-vets-exposed-to-burn-pits)<br>
> — Jon Stewart

### Use Case 1

Joe is a veteran who separated from the military 6 years ago and is looking for more information about burn pit exposure, having visited multiple deployed locations.

He started to fill out the VA Burn Pit Registry but ran into roadblocks due to the number of form fields required and with a lack of defined dates, times and locations to enter. Joe also wanted to be in control of his own data in order to advocate for himself and realized data sharing from the VA was mostly unidirectional.

### Use Case 2

Mary is a journalist who is writing a feature article about burn pits and the risk to veterans. 

She understands the premise of burn pits based on summary research but wants to do a deeper dive and explore / verify new links and relationships that will help her write a story that gets picked up and distributed.
